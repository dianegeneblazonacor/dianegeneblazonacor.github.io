            <p class = "plot">Jose Rizal was a Filipino polymath whose martyrdom helped spark the revolution of the Philippines from Spanish occupation. Read about his life, works, and legacy.

                On June 19th 1861, the Mercado Family from the town of Calamba in the province of Laguna in the Philippines, happily greeted the birth of their newest member — a baby boy born as the seventh child to proud parents Francisco Rizal Mercado y Alejandro and Teodora Alonso Realonda y Quintos. They named the bouncing baby boy Jose Protasio Rizal Mercado.
                
                Being the seventh of a brood of eleven, Jose Rizal Mercado demonstrated an astounding intelligence and aptitude for learning at a very young age when he learned his letters from his mother and could read and write at the age of five.</p>
